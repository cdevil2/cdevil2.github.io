            This website is really cool because it’s so interactive! You can draw a stick figure who will go on different adventures. As if that wasn’t cool enough, you get to draw items for him to get through his quest. Most of the features on the website are handrawn, which is not common for websites. This page welcomes users to tap into their imagination.

          This is the website of a stage and set designer, Katarzyna Konkowska. The first thing about this website that grabs my attention is the beautiful animation that flows across the screen each time you navigate to a different section. The navigation is also simple and easy to figure out. The photos act as links to a selection of even more photos of each stage/set design to look at. What really completes this website is the atmospheric background music that plays as you navigate through it. It’s peaceful and mysterious and really immerses you into the artist’s unique designs.

        <p>This website is simple, but it's one of the most entertaining and comical sites I've ever seen. You can type in a word, phrase, or senetence and then translate it to Snoop Dogg lingo. I think the fact that this site is set up almost exactly like Google adds to the humor of it.
